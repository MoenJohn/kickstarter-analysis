# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this written report and analysis will attempt to describe Kickstarter campaign outcomes both based on their launch dates and on their funding goals. Included is the dataset, the relevant and analyzed data from that dataset (both in the Excel doc) along with some charts generated from them and my analysis in this README. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize Kickstarter campaign outcomes in relation to two factors: launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis itself was fairly straight forward with little difficulties, TBC

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
